# INTRODUCTION

I am going to share information about variables today .

# BODY

What is a variable ?

- A variable is a container that stores data values for Javascript . A variable is anything that can vary..

- Variable naming
  There are two types of limitations on variable names in JavaScript:

1 The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and \_.
2 The first character must not be a digit.

- When the name contains multiple words, camelCase is commonly used. That is: words go one after another, each word except first starting with a capital letter: myVeryFirstDate.

- Also pay attention to Case matters because variables named apple and AppLE are two different variables.

- Constants -This is used to declare a constant (unchanging) variable, we use const instead of let:

Here is a short summary
We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.

let – In short, let helps us by making it easier to see where variables live in our code.
var – Variables can be changed.
const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed. It is advisable to use const when you are sure a variable will not be redeclared..

# CONCLUSION

These variable types are unique in their own way and serve to make code development efficient, however, it is advised to use let whenever possible and const whenever the value of the variable is to remain constant.
