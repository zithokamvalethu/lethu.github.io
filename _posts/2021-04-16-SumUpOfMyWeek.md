# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about how my week went. So I have decided that every Friday I'm going to write about how my week was , the ups and the downs .


# BODY
I'm going to  go through day by day and summarise everything I've done .

So when we got back here on Monday I first opened FreeCodeCamp , and there after tried to solve the particular challenge I was given but really  could not because It was so tricky and had too much code so I did not know what to start doing then . It took me quite a long time to understand the theory on that challenge but finally I managed to put my logic behind it and try to solve it .The problem only required a small change in the code, I had to return 'getTea(40); also console.log(teaForTeamFCC); and that was it ! After passing the challenge I felt some enthusiasm and decided to continue and I passed the other following challenge because it was almost like the previous one . I got stuck on the third challenge and decided to go do more information about FP . I did some typing and tried to solve kata but they were just giving me a beating but I managed to do two with the help of my rough notes and GOOGLE. 
The following day was dedicated for my APP which is a task Moral gave us to do ,and I did some typing because it is what we are expected to do everyday. After lunch I solved some kata and did went to FreeCodeCamp to try and look at the problem I had encountered the previous day and luckily I gained some knowledge but it still needed to be polished. And the same goes for the other days but what is different is that we were given problems to solve by Njabulo and Moral the past days . So what I've come to reaalise is that I need to go back to fiunctions and the forLoop because I don't understand them very well. 

My highs for this week are literally being able to display my data on my table from my app and understanding the whole concept. Also meeting Mr Mandla because I was really nervous so I was glad that he came by and gave us a real talk .
And the low-lights for my week is finding out that I have a lot to do regarding the Forloop because I was really struggling with solving the problems

# CONCLUSION
I really enjoyed being at The Coding Ground , and I am starting to enjoy more what I am doing . I still have a long way to go but I'm prepared for the fun ride.
