# INTRODUCTION

Today I was still busy with Quality Assurance but luckily on the last part of it. I have encountered things like headless browsers so I wanted to learn about those and see what is the use for them.<br>

# BODY

Headless browsers are browsers without (Graphical User Interface)GUI. They are able to render ans read HTML, CSS and JavaScript the same way and other regular browser would, making it usable in limited enviroments like Replit.<br>
The main use cases for headless browsers are:

Test automation in modern web applications (web testing)
Taking screenshots of web pages.<br>Running automated tests for JavaScript libraries.<br>Automating interaction of web pages.<br>And then we also have other types of headless browswer such as Zombie.js and Mocha.<br>
Zombie.js
A lightweigth headless browser that doesnt' depend on additina; binaries to be installed. This feature makes it useful in limited enviroments like Replit.<br>Mocha- Allows you to run some code before any other actual test run. This can be useful to do things likw entries to databease which will be used in the rest of the tests.<br>

# CONCLUSION

I've learnt that when we are working with headless browsers before running a code you need to visit a site/ page you'll be testing. And that we also have something called suiteSetup hook- that executes only once at the beginning of a test suite.<br>Tomorrow I will solve this challenge on Free code camp since I couldn't do it today as I was searching and trying to understand what are headless browsers.<br> Run Functional Tests Using a Headless Browser
