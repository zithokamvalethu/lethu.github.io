# Introduction
  Today I'll write about how  I got to understand the bsic of FP. I was stuck on one challenge which  had no clue what it required or how to solve it.

  # Body

  I asked Moral to try and explain to me what FP could be all about and he made me understand that it is a language which uses a ccertain paradigm by applying and composing functions . He also made me see that FP is immutable the code still remain the same despite the change you make to your code but your values remain the same . 
  So this is basically what I got to understand today.

What is Functional Programming?
Functional programming (also called FP) is a way of thinking about software construction by creating pure functions. It avoid concepts of shared state, mutable data observed in Object Oriented Programming.

Also the Characteristics of Functional Programming are
1.Functional programming method focuses on results, not the process
2.Emphasis is on what is to be computed
3.Data is immutable
4.Functional programming Decompose the problem into 'functions
5.It is built on the concept of mathematical functions which uses conditional expressions and recursion to do perform the calculation
6.It does not support iteration like loop statements and conditional statements like If-Else


# Conclusion
Now I know that FP focuses on the result and the result is always immutable. Immutable Data means that you should easily able to create data structures instead of modifying ones which is already exist it can no tbe reversed or changed. Also today I was not feeling too goo dit was one of those days my spirit was unhappy and torn.
