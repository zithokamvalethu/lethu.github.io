# INTRODUCTION

Today I began with Quality Assurance even though I finished with Back end the previous week on Friday.<br> I think I was not ready to start something new I wanted to reflect on the previous segment I had just finsished to see if I really understood what I was doing.<br>

# BODY

Quality assurance (QA) is any systematic process of determining whether a product or service meets specified requirements.<br>

QA establishes and maintains set requirements for developing or manufacturing reliable products.<br> A quality assurance system is meant to increase customer confidence and a company's credibility, while also improving work processes and efficiency, and it enables a company to better compete with others.<br>
Importance of quality assurance
Quality assurance helps a company create products and services that meet the needs, expectations and requirements of customers.<br> It yields high-quality product offerings that build trust and loyalty with customers.<br> The standards and procedures defined by a quality assurance program help prevent product defects before they arise.<br>

Quality assurance methods.<br>
Quality assurance utilizes one of three methods:

Failure testing, which continually tests a product to determine if it breaks or fails.<br> For physical products that need to withstand stress, this could involve testing the product under heat, pressure or vibration.<br> For software products, failure testing might involve placing the software under high usage or load conditions.<br>
Statistical process control (SPC), a methodology based on objective data and analysis and developed by Walter Shewhart at Western Electric Company and Bell Telephone Laboratories in the 1920's and 1930's.<br> This methodology uses statistical methods to manage and control the production of products.<br>
Total quality management (TQM), which applies quantitative methods as the basis for continuous improvement.<br> TQM relies on facts, data and analysis to support product planning and performance reviews.<br>

# CONCLUSION

Tomorrow I'll going ibn depth into Qaulity Assurance as I've only started today and it is still an easy ride.
