# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about the use of methods as a combination which is something I use on the new Javascript tests. I have remarked that you execute everything as a unit right now.


# BODY
The methods come together to perform a certain function. They carry out a duty and when used as a unit. Not every function is fit for every function. What is needed most is understanding what does the instruction command you to do. Once you understand what you want to do you will know that the test only expects you to do a certain thing but not a bunch of things. To undertake these tests I write my code explanation on the side and look at all the options I have and then strip everything down to a level where I finally understand everything. The tests on the new FreeCodeCamp topic are a bit hard and I am willing to learn by bits and pieces.


# CONCLUSION
The tutorial video I downloaded trusting that it will help clarify things to me and make me understand the topic entirely but it is just not valuable because they are solving without explaining their code. So I plan to go back to my old journals and look wholly at the methods and every Regex code I did I believe that will be helpful.
