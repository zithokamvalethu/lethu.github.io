# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write a summary of my day.


# BODY
Today was a bit hectic. I  had to re-do everything on my Javascript file. I had to wipe my code and write it in a new way because the way I had done it could only achieve few things and I was caught up. The code I had written for my Recipe box could Add recipe but going forward I could not edit or delete my recipes. I could not do CodeCamp because I needed to understand what I was required to do to create a phone number validator. I jotted down some notes t help during my weekend to understand what I need to do. On Codewars I came along a challenge that was so hard and I also decided to write a discussion and code explanation to help me to understand so that next time when I do it it won't give me a hustle.

# CONCLUSION

During the weekend I'll be looking at CodeCamp and try to complete the projects, read programming books and read the set of notes I took this week.
