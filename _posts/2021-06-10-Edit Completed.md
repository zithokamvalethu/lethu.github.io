# INTRODCTION
Today I am going to write about completing my Edit input.

# BODY
It was quite a handy task completing the edit input. I had started with it since the beginning of this week.<br> I was able to pick a lot of mistakes I had made on the way which is one of the positives.<br> The edit input I had was not interactive and I had to fix that.<br> I realized that I had been wasting time trying to do the impossible by wanting my edit input to update and remove when I click on it and add the new value I want to update with.<br> The easier way I could do it was to create another input on my index.html file and also create another submit button so that when I want to update I can achieve that.<br> Today finally a victory for me I succeeded with that and now I can finally turn my attention back to FreeCodeCamp.<br>

# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I plan on doing a lot of work on Codewars and FreeCodeCamp. On FreeCodeCamp I plan on going back to the challenges I've completed and get a full understand everything I've done the past few weeks.
