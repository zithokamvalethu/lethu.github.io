# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write React Javascript Ternary expression condition today. 

# BODY
You can use Ternary expression for any conditional rendering. Ternary expressin condition to render what you like . Ternary is often utilized as the shortcut for if/else statement in Javascript. 
For example
codition? expressionIfTrue:expressionIfFalse.

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.
