React Table is a workhorse. It's built to materialize, filter, sort, group, aggregate, paginate and display massive data sets using a very small API surface. 
How do you make a table in react?

Start With a Basic React Data Table. First, create a basic data table component that receives as props an array of headings and an array of rows. Map over these two arrays to extract cell content then break <Cell /> up into its subcomponent and pass content to it.

How do you make a table responsive in react?
Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive across all viewports by adding property responsive .
# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow when I come back I plan on working on my table until I am able to make it work.
