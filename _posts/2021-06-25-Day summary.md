# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about all I've been doing starting from FreeCodeCamp right up to the Admin App and Codewars.

# BODY
Today in FreeCodeCamp I did quite a lot and finally can say I know all about setting classes to a div and arranging elements in a row and grid or column. It is quite easy and the syntax to set or align your things in grid or column is as follows 
syntax :
col-md-*
md stands for medium - so we can say after 'col' it is the size.
* is a number specifying how many columns you want.
I learnt how to style responsively but then every styling on Bootstrap should be resposive. The other thing is that you use div's a lot every element should or must be within one div but each and every single element should be within its div.
On Codewars I did not do a lot I learnt hoe to sort an array by the string length.
On the Admin App I have made a lot of progress because I have all the functions but made a couple of errors which need fixing and also have a function for displaying on my table.


# CONCLUSION
I have difficulties with setting items to localStorage so during my weekend I will take a deep look into that.
