# INTRODUCTION
Today I was a lot busy I started with the React tutorial it is not a video it is a learn and do. So once I started understanding React I went on to do a few challenges on the FreeCodeCamp. I basiclly chose to do the challenges because it was dealing with Props which is a subject I am still struggling with. After that I went on to finish up the count down app activity. I realised I had made a slight mistake I created the count dowm app outside the Repository, but I managed to fix my mistake.

# BODY
What are Props in React?
Another important concept of components is how they communicate. React has a special object called a prop (stands for property) which we use to transport data from one component to another.
- Props are custom values and they also make components more dynamic.
React Props Are Really Useful
So React developers use props to pass data and they're useful for this job. But what about managing data? Props are used for passing data, not for manipulating it. This is the information I gathered about Props.


I am going to focus on the challenge that's giving a problem to solve on FreeCodeCamp

Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect
React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. I am currently having a difficulty understanding the explanation above so I am going to solve it when I know everything.



# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I still have a lot of work , I have to create a React RSVP app and double check the count down timer app, and I still have to do FreeCodeCamp.
