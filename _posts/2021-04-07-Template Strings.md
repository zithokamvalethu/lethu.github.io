# INTRODUCTION

Today I am going to write about TEMPLATE STRINGS/LITERALS which is one the challenges I came across on Codewars.

# BODY

What are template strings ?
Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
Template strings enclosed by the backtick (` `).

Template literals also make it easy to write multiline strings.

With template literals, it's a bit easier to include variables and expressions inside a string.

The process of assigning variables and expressions inside the template literal is known as interpolation.

Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces (${expression}). The expressions in the placeholders and the text between the backticks (` `) get passed to a function.

# CONCLUSION

You can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with template strings.

-Interpolating Variables and Expressions
We insert a variable or expression by adding a dollar sign $ and curly braces {} into the string `${variable}`.

-Multiline Strings
Another great feature of template strings is that we can have strings with multiple lines for better code readability.
