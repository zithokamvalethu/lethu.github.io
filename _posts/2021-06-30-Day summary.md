# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about my day.


# BODY
Today I fixed my code for the Admin App. ON my code there were many mistakes which I could not spot at first but when I gave it time to understand and read it carefully I spotted them. I realized that reading your code is important and understanding is crucial. My app now can submit but I get many undefined values which I still need to work on that. My code needs to change there and there so that my app  wil function correctly.

# CONCLUSION
For the next couple of days I'll be spending home I will be watching tutorials.
