# INTRODUCTION

I am going to write about too create an edit button with Rect Js. I am still implementing the edit element to my Employee tracker app.


# BODY
This is where I'll explain how it is done.

How do I add a Edit button in react?
You can have an internal editing state, based on which the component renders either the input field with the default value as the current value for that field or the <span> . It flips to true when you press the edit button.

How do I make a form editable in react?
resetForm() to initialise props. values as the original values from parent component and set the formik edit status to false. Lastly is Save Button, This will automatically goes to handleSubmit function which we pass the function from parent component parent to update the state of the form.

# CONCLUSION
I touched on how to edit a form and how to add an Edit button with React.
