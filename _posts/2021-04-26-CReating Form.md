# Introduction
Today I will write about craeating a form.

# Body
Creating the form
There are few differences between a straight HTML form and a JavaScript-enhanced form. The main one being that a JavaScript form relies on one or more event handlers, such as onClick or onSubmit. These invoke a JavaScript action when the user does something in the form, like clicking a button. The event handlers, which are placed with the rest of the attributes in the HTML form tags, are invisible to a browser that don't support JavaScript. Because of this trait, you can often use one form for both JavaScript and non-JavaScript browsers.

Typical form control objects -- also called "widgets" -- include the following:

Text box for entering a line of text
Push button for selecting an action
Radio buttons for making one selection among a group of options
Check boxes for selecting or deselecting a single, independent option

# Conclusion
I had to learn this for preparing for the test that I will write on Thursday .
