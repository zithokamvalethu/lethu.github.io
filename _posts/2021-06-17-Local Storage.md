---# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about Local storage which is something we have to implement in our latest task.<br> Our task is to do an admin app and save the data on local storage so that when I refresh the Browser the information does not disappear<br> 
- I conducted my research on local storage today and I will write about what I understand with the way the code should be<br> 
- Also today I spent most of my time on the Admin App,codewars and watching and reading tutorials on local storage<br> 
- My highlight for the day would be the fact that I can convert from one form to the other on codewars I finally understand how it works from such a long time teaching myself how to approach these challenges<br>  However I do not declare myself as perfect I can get a challenge that will beat me so all-on-all I need to make this a craft that needs perfection<br> 

# BODY
What is local storage?

Local storage is where you data that you have saved on your browser is captured and stored, It will still be there no matter how many times you refresh the browser you will still find it after a day, month or year<br>  It is read-only<br> 
- The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser<br> 
First, on your Html page, you will:
1) create a <div></div>,my <div> should have a class set to Storage and also have a <p></p> for a text with class text<br> 
2) Inside your <div> you add 'inputs'<br> 
3) And then a 'save button'

On the Javascript file :
1) I will start by adding a var by 
a) const storageInput =(and use the document<br> getElementByID)
B) const for text =(and use the document<br> getElementByID)
c) const button = (and use the document<br> getElementByID)
2)For the storageInput add an eventListener which takes ('input',word)

Thus far this is all I know and I am not sure about whether this will work or not because I did not practice it at all<br> 

# CONCLUSION 
Tomorrow I will be doing the FreeCodeCamp challenges and also solve katas on Codewars<br>  I will still do a lot of typing and deal with my task for the Admin App<br>
