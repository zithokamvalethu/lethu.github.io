# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about the test that I wrote today. I will share about how I managed to do it and where did I fail.

# BODY
Starting with the test it was quite easy and I managed to do the HTML part without any hustles, although the only thing which I think I did wrong is creating five different html files for the Big fives, I realise I could've done it in one html file , but for the sake of wanting to understand my work I separated my files for neat work also.

I made quite a bunch of mistakes starting by not writing instructions on my readMe file and submitting it as it is. Another error I committed is on my JS file I did not insert audio of the animal to make sound when you hover ... On the other my pictutures do not hover over and that too bad because that is the most important thing I had to implement on the picture . I lost track of time and had to bring to a close and submit the test. 
I will not blame time because it was amplified I just couldn't work well with the given time.


# CONCLUSION
So next time I need to manage my time and follow instructions never miss what they are commanding me to do...
