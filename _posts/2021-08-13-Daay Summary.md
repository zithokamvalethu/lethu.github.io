# INTRODUCTION
Today I got busy a lot, doing FreeCodeCamp, watching tutorial vidoes and reading articles about react.


#
I learnt about: Low-fidelity wireframes act as the initial blueprints for web pages and app screens. They help your stakeholders focus on a page's key purpose and functionality by deliberately excluding any specific details like colours, fonts, logos, and exact sizing â€“ all of which can be added later...
I have also started with the RSVP app and I have not done a lot but hopefully on Monday I will have a lot of progress.

With FreeCodeCamp I am almost done but still trying to learn as much as I can slowly.


# CONCLUSION

On Monday I have to prepare a presentation about User stories.
