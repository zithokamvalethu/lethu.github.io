# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write about my Monday and the work I was doing.


# BODY
Today I've been doing a lot of work on FreeCodeCamp. I did and finished all the Bootstrap challenges and it has taught me a lot on how to style responsively your website or application. With bootstrsap its a lot easier to apply styling and you don't always need to use an id to apply a certain styling and the styling is applied directly.

Codewars
I also solved katas that were not really that much complicated today. I also have an advanced knowledge about Binary so now it is still simple to solve katas that require the application of Binary knowledge.


Admin App
I managed to fix my functions and the errors I was getting before are solved so I reckon that what is the major part is the local storage part implementing it so that I will be finished with the APP.

# CONCLUSION
TOmorrow I will be focusing on the new topic I have started on FreeCodeCamp the jQuery and do put local storage code on mny app .
