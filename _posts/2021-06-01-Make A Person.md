# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about the challenge I was doing on FreeCodeCamp that was so challenging but in the end I could do it .


# BODY
The challenge was so hard because I did not know what I had to do and how my code should be .

The instruction was to 'fill in the objects with different methods so that when you run the code we see the expected output .
We're working with a function expression, with an argument of firstAndLast.
It is an object constructor that we need to complete. The instructions mention methods which must be included in the object constructor.
The argument for this constructor is firstAndLast, which will be a string of a first and last name, separated by a white space .
For setFirstName(), we'll have it take in an argument, and then update the firstName variable to the new one provided in this function.
The most challenging method is setFullName(). We will have to replace both variables with the new argument provided in this function. Like the argument of the constructor function, we assume (based off the test cases), it will be a string with a first and last name, separated by a white space.

# CONCLUSION
This challenge was more unique than other challenges but I  managed to deal with it well.
