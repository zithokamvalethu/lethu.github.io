# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to touch on Comparisons and a topic I've touched on, on this day.

# BODY 

Comparisons Operators

- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.<br>
- They compare two values and give back a boolean value: either true or false.<br>

1)Example 1: Equal to Operator
== evaluates to true if the operands are equal.<br>

2)Example 2: Not Equal to Operator
!= evaluates to true if the operands are not equal.

3)Example 3: Strict Equal to Operator
=== evaluates totrue if the operands are equal and of the same type. Here 2 and '2' are the same numbers but the data type is different. And === also checks for the data type while comparing.<br>

4)Example 4: Strict Not Equal to Operator
!== evaluates to true if the operands are strictly not equal. It's the complete opposite of strictly equal ===.<br>

5)Example 5: Greater than Operator
(>) evaluates to true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.<br>

6)Example 6: Greater than or Equal to Operator
(>=) evaluates to true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.<br>

7)Example 7: Less than Operator
(<) evaluates to true if the left operand is less than the right operand.<br>

8) Example 8: Less than or Equal to Operator
(<= )evaluates to true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.<br>

9)Example 9: Logical AND Operator.
&& evaluates to true if both the operands are true, else evaluates to false.

10)Example 10: Logical OR Operator.
|| evaluates to true if either of the operands is true. If both operands are false, the result is false.

11)Example 11: Logical NOT Operator.
! evaluates to true if the operand is false and vice-versa.

# CONCLSUION
These comparisons operators are handy when dealing with challenges that uses for loops and involve sum logic and math in them.
