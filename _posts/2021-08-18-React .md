# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about important concepts in React.

# BODY
- Expressions in JSX
You can include a JavaScript expression using a pair of curly brackets anywhere within JSX:

- React Virtual DOM
If you are using React or learning React, you must have heard of the term “Virtual DOM”. Now what is a Virtual DOM, and why does React use it?
Virtual DOM
That’s where the concept of virtual DOM comes in and performs significantly better than the real DOM. The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM. Every time the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.
-How does React use Virtual DOM
In React every UI piece is a component, and each component has a state. React follows the observable pattern and listens for state changes. When the state of a component changes, React updates the virtual DOM tree. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React then compares the current version of the virtual DOM with the previous version of the virtual DOM. This process is called “diffing”.


# CONCLUSION
These are some of the concepts.
