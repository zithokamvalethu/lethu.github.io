# INTRODUCTION
Toaday I am going write about the project I finsihed on FreeCodeCamp.



# BODY
The Ceasar's Cipher is a simple, popular, and effective way of encrypting a message from prying eyes. Named after Julius Caesar (of Little Caesar's Pizza fame and possibly an empire), the way this cipher works is by generating an encrypted message by shifting the letters in an original message by a fixed amount.<br>  

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

the challenge wanted me to rotate to the 13th place and I used the replace and test methods to do it.


# CONCLUSION
I finished this test and tomorrow will do the rest of the projects.
