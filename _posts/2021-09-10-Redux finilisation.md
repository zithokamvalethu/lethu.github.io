# INTRODUCTION
Today I completed Redux and I am going to write a short summary. I can say that Redux was not too challenging I did come across challenges but I have managed to overcome them.
# BODY
Redux is a library for managing global application state
Redux is typically used with the React-Redux library for integrating Redux and React together
Redux Toolkit is the recommended way to write Redux logic
Redux uses several types of code
Actions are plain objects with a type field, and describe "what happened" in the app
Reducers are functions that calculate a new state value based on previous state + an action
A Redux store runs the root reducer whenever an action is dispatched

Data Flow
We can summarize the flow of data through a Redux app by the following order to represents how:

actions are dispatched in response to a user interaction like a click
the store runs the reducer function to calculate a new state
the UI reads the new state to display the new values

# CONCLUSION
In Redux I have learned that you declare variables most of the time and you assign to a method also in many challenges.
