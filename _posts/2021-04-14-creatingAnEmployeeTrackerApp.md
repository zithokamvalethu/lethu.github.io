# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to talk about how it was creating the latest App task we were given by Moral. I am not yet done with it but at least I wanna share about whatever I have managed to cover and do .

# BODY
So I had started with the app and because I was looking at examples it was easy at first to compile the table and the inputs , also because I had done something like it before I still had a clue of how to begin with it.
Once my inputs were there and the entry button was also there it seemed like an accomplishment although I had no clue what to do next to make them function and so that my app performs the expected tasks and functions. I was stuck not knowing which step to take next or what is required of me to do next... So for a day I did not do anything to my app  trying to figure out what is next. I watched a couple of tutorials and gathered all the information I needed to guide me going forward. With the information I acquired from the tutorials I made changes to my app and I saw a bit of green light and that kept me going . I enjoyed being at TCG today because I could see where I am going , when you doing something you enjoy time flies because in no time I had an hour left and decided to stop for the day and proceed tomorrow . What I have noticed about me is that I learn from hearing, seeing and doing things practically myself too. The catch is that I don't have to put myself under pressure when things are not going my way rather rest and not quit . My biggest achievement for today was seeing my code display .And now I have to focus on the 'edit , delete, complete' options and I think it will be quite aa great challenge because i'm not too good with functions and that is one topic I need to switch my attention to.


# CONCLUSION
Today started as a boring and lazy day for me but once I was infront of the screen I started applying and pushing myself so that I don't loose the information I have and waste 'today' because I know time lost is never regained. I am so ecstatic for myself and I know definitely from today onwards creating apps will be my favourite task , I will enjoy the challege that they pose to me.
