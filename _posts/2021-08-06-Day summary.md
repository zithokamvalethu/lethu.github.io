# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write about my progress today.

# BODY
I continued even today to watch Tutorials for React and got to learn a lot. I couldn't do the activity because I spent a lot of time teaching myself about React and doing the challenges on FreeCodeCamp. I have been learning a lot ranging from React DOM, React components and React component composition.
Some information would be : To compose components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:
return (
 <App>
  <Navbar />
  <Dashboard />
  <Footer />
 </App>
)


# CONCLUSION
During my spare time I will try and write more notes about React and also write a bit of codes for React.
