# INTRODUCTION
This will be my summary for the day. I will be writing down everything I di today.



# BODY
Today when I came here I did a backgtound search on React because this is the part of FreeCodeCamp that I am doing.After compiling my notes I went on to do a few challenges. It was not so easy because it was the first encounter with the topic. After solving a few chsllenges I went on to Code wars and also came across taughtful challenges which I solved with a bit of struggle but managed to overcome the challenge.
I have been able to restart my Admin App today and the things which I have done with success so far is creating a function which adds and also creating a function that displays. Tomorrow I have to create two more functions that EDIT and DELETE.After being to do so I need to focus on local storage and validation of the inputs. I have started with validation but I still need to do more.

Tomorrow I will be doing a lot of work on FreeCodeCamp and on the Admin app.
