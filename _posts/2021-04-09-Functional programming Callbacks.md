# INTRODUCTION
I will write about callbacks which is a function I came across while solving the FreeCodeCamp challenges. The are quite a few but today I will focus on the one which I understood more than any other function which were part of the FP terminology.


# BODY 
What are callbacks?
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. It may be passed in Other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array..

Or 
callbacks are functions passed as an argument to another function

This technique allows a function to call another function

A callback function can run after another function has finished.

Although this could mean one and same thing the other definition elaborates more than the other so it helps in understanding the real meaning and the technique.

Why do we need callbacks?
Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.


# CONLUSION
So I now understand that A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
