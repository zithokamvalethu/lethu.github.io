# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write jQuery which is a topic I started today.

# BODY
What is jQuery?
-jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

What is the use of jQuery ?
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery for me is more complicated than Bootstrap. It just require thourough reading and knowledge. So I am taking things step by step.

# CONCLUSION
So my focus tomorrow will be on the App because I am not yet done.
