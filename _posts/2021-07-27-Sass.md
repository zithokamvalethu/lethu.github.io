# INTRODUCTION
Today I started on a new topic and I am going to write about it. I will be describing and talking about what I learned.



# BODY
What is SASS?
Sass is - SYNTECTICALLY Awesome StyleSheets- It is a language extension of CSS.<br> It adds features that aren't available on basic CSS, which makes it easier for you to simplify and maintain the style sheets for your projects.<br>

How to Store Data with Sass variable?<br>
Sass starts with '$' followed by variable name.<br>
for example :
- $main-fonts: Arial, sans-serief;<br>

  In order to use variables : <br>
  font-family:$main-fonts;<br>

  Why do we use SASS?
  1) It's CSS syntax friendly<br>
  2) It offers variables for whatever you want<br>
  3) It uses nested syntax<br>
  4) It includes mixins <br>

# CONCLUSION

By far this all I've done and learned on SASS.<br> The benefits of using Sass which I've only named four of them are the ones which I've completed the challenges. <br> I was also a tutorial for my App so tomorrow I am going to re-do most of my inputs so that I do what I learned on the tutorial.
