# INTRODUCTION
I will write about the Reduce method today.nI came across it on one of the challenge in FreeCodeCamp.

# BODY
 What is the reduce method?
 Reduce is a method that can be difficult to understand especially with all the vague explanations..
Definition and Usage
The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.

The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).

The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).

Note: reduce() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

 This method does not change the original array.

 # CONCLUSION
 
 Syntax
array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)
