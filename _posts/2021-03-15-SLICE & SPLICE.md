# INTRODUCTION
I will write about splice and slice .

# BODY
The splice():method adds or removes items to or from an array, and returns the removed item(s).
This changes the original array 

The slice() :method returns the selected elements in an array, as a new array object.
The original array  will not be changed.

# CONCLUSION
These two methods are important for copying each element of the first array into into the second array in order.
