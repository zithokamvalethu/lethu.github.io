# INTRODUCTION
 Today I am going to write about a concept I focused on when solving katas. This is the 'Binary' concept.

# BODY
  WHAT IS BINARY?
JavaScript strings are UTF-16 encoded strings. This means that each code unit requires two bytes of memory and is able to represent 65535 different code points.<br> 
WHAT IS A BINARY CODE?

Binary code uses the digits of 0 and 1 (binary numbers) to represent computer instructions or text.<br>
 
 I've learnt about a lot opf binary conversions my knowledge about conversion as a whole is a bit vast compared to the beginning.<br> Solving pronlems about conversion from binary to other forms is a bit hard but I have been capable to solve them.<br> The only recent problem I have not yet been able to solve is a problem that says "Decimal to binary converter" this particular one is a bit of a challenge to solve because I am restricted not to use the 'toString' method. <br>

# CONCLUSION
  This is one the of the challenges I have solved today 
- Instructions
Complete the function which converts hex number (given as a string) to a decimal number.<br>

- Solutions

 function hexToDec(hexString){
  return parseInt (hexString,16)
  //your code here
}
