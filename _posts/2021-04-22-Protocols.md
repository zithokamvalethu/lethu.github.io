# INTRODUCTION 
The topic we are writing about today was specifically chosen by Moral but it was something which Jason was talking about. It is definitely not the first time i've heard the word but based on the computer side I am not sure what it really means or is about , hence I went to Google to search about it and gathered this portion of information.  

# BODY
So in my knowldge I know that the word Protocols means that rules or laws that you have to follow or abide by .
Protocols basically in networking is the established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted , essentially it also allows devices to communicate.
The types of Protocols 
1 Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
2 Internet Protocol (IP)
3 User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
4 Post office Protocol (POP)
5 Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP)
6 File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
7 Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
8 Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
8 Telnet
9 Gopher

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a popular communication protocol which is used for communicating over a network. It divides any message into series of packets that are sent from source to destination and there it gets reassembled at the destination.
Internet Protocol (IP): IP is designed explicitly as addressing protocol. It is mostly used with TCP. The IP addresses in packets help in routing them through different nodes in a network until it reaches the destination system. TCP/IP is the most popular protocol connecting the networks.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP): UDP is a substitute communication protocol to Transmission Control Protocol implemented primarily for creating loss-tolerating and low-latency linking between different applications.
Post office Protocol (POP): POP3 is designed for receiving incoming E-mails.
Simple mail transport Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is designed to send and distribute outgoing E-Mail.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP allows users to transfer files from one machine to another. Types of files may include program files, multimedia files, text files, and documents, etc.
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is designed for transferring a hypertext among two or more systems. HTML tags are used for creating links. These links may be in any form like text or images. HTTP is designed on Client-server principles which allow a client system for establishing a connection with the server machine for making a request. The server acknowledges the request initiated by the client and responds accordingly.
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS): HTTPS is abbreviated as Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure is a standard protocol to secure the communication among two computers one using the browser and other fetching data from web server. HTTP is used for transferring data between the client browser (request) and the web server (response) in the hypertext format, same in case of HTTPS except that the transferring of data is done in an encrypted format. So it can be said that https thwart hackers from interpretation or modification of data throughout the transfer of packets.
Telnet: Telnet is a set of rules designed for connecting one system with another. The connecting process here is termed as remote login. The system which requests for connection is the local computer, and the system which accepts the connection is the remote computer.
Gopher: Gopher is a collection of rules implemented for searching, retrieving as well as displaying documents from isolated sites. Gopher also works on the client/server principle.

# CONCLUSION
If not for the internet I wouldn't have known all this information. My task is to understand why they are there and know how to differentiate between all of them
