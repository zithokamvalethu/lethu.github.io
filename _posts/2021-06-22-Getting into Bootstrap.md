# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about starting with Bootstrap and what I have been busy with.

# BODY

Bootstrap -Bootstrap is a front end framework used to design responsive web pages and applications. It takes a mobile-first approach to web development, and includes pre-built CSS styles and classes, plus some JavaScript functionality.

Bootstrap hasn't given me any challenges at the moment and I am taking it day by day and being patient with myself because I don't want to lose any information that I might need in future.  It working for me to do a few challenges per day while taking down important notes to help me study or reflect when I am at home.

TodaY I was busy with the Admnin App we were given by Moral. For now I have every input in place I just need to write down correct code for the inputs to work. I have managed to achieve quite a few stuff and hope that the Javascript functions I will be writing will work for the app. One last thing I need to do is to set my data to the local storage.


# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I am going to start with writing functions that add my data to the local storage and learn about validation for my inputs.
