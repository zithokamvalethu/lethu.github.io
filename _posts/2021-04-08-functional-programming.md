# INTRODUCTION
Todays post will be based on Functional programming.

# BODY
WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?
Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope:INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
or
Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.


Functional programming is about:

-Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change.

-Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output.

-Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled.


# CONCLUSION 
 This all that I know because it is the information I gathered before attempting to solve the challenges on FreeCodeCamp. I felt it was important to do so because I need prior knowledge so that I am able to apply my knowledge when I start solving problems .
