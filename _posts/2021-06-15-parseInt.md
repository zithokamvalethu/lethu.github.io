# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about the parseInt function.

# BODY
What is a parseInt function?

- The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix.

The Syntax
- parseInt(string, radix)
-- string:	Required. The string to be parsed.
-- radix- Optional. A number that represents the numeral system to be used between 2 and 36..

Return value
An integer parsed from the given string Or NaN when:

the radix is smaller than 2 or bigger than 36, or
the first non-whitespace character cannot be converted to a number.
# CONCLUSION
While this simple form of the function is easy to understand it is not the recommended syntax. This function is handy when working with numbers.
