# INTRODUCTION
Today I began with tackling the Free code camp React Redux challenges. I did now have a huge problem with solving the first problem. Moving on to the next challenge I face a problem with a certain component I had to do but in the end I ended up getting it right.

# BODY
This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React. First, here's a review of some of the key principles of each technology. React is a view library that you provide with data, then it renders the view in an efficient, predictable way. Redux is a state management framework that you can use to simplify the management of your application's state. Typically, in a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app. Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.

Although React components can manage their own state locally, when you have a complex app, it's generally better to keep the app state in a single location with Redux. There are exceptions when individual components may have local state specific only to them. Finally, because Redux is not designed to work with React out of thebox , you need to use the react-redux package. It provides a way for you to pass Redux state and dispatch to your React components as props.

# CONCLUSION
This how they explained React Redux to us and I can say that it is going to be challenging but I am willing to be persistent and hardworking.
