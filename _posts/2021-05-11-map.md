# INTRODUCTION

Today I will write about the map method independently and write a code example.

# BODY
The map() method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function or each element.

example :
let people= [{name:"kamva"
, surname:"zitho"},{name:"musa"
, surname:"langa"},{name:"john"
, surname:"harvey"},{name:"steve"
, surname:"austin"},{name:"halle"
, surname:"berry"}]

let showNames = people.map(person=>{
    console.log(person.name)
})


# CONCLUSION
The map() does this without mutating the original array . This means it makes no altarnations to the array .
