# INTRODUCTION

Today I will share about what I was doing on FreeCodeCamp and give an example of one of the challenges I did.


# BODY
I was mostly solving challenges that used 'filter' or either 'map' or slice but i've chosen to write about the one which I grasped quickly. I'll also touch on the other methods a bit so that I cover everything I did today and make sure I write a full update .
Using the map method - the crucial part I had to remember was how the map method is used in order to implement it on the solution ... So I understood that on that particular challenge the was a certain way I had to use the map method which was ' const names = user.map(user => user.name);  
console.log(names)thereafter console.log my function which is the example on how to approach the challenge .
Using the slice method - Slice returns a copy of certain elements of an array , it takes two arguments :
1) gives index of where to begin the slice
2) gives index of where to end the slice 
 Using the filter method - this method filters the array based on the function passed to it .
 The challenge required me to use the filter method in order to return the movies rating and it also had a condition and for it I had to create an if statement so that the test will pass, the test only had to return the title of the movie that fitted into the condition so it was quite a challenge creating a code that will pass therefore I had to turn to Google which gave me a start on how to approach my challenge and in the end it worked and passed.
The less complicated solution I had to write was the on of how to implement the filter method on the prototype

Solution 
this.forEach(individualElement => ); {
    if (callback(individualElement)){
    newArray.push(individualElement);
    }
});

# CONCLUSION
Thus far I see that everything works hand in hand and the more you mpve too the next phase things get more complex but you need to always be intact , never miss anything always remember your work because everything is a build up to what you've already learnt and you memery needs to be excellent.
