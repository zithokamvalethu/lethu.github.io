# INTRODUCTION

I am going to write a blog post about rendiring conditionally from props. That is a challenge which I came across on Free code camp.

# BODY

How do you conditionally render a prop?
Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them. This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop.

Does changing props cause re render?
A re-render can only be triggered if a component's state has changed. The state can change from a props change, or from a direct setState change. The component gets the updated state and React decides if it should re-render the component.

What is conditional rendering in React?

Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API.


# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I will start reading a book called 'The road to react'.
