# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about how to check Palimdromes.

# BODY
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. The word “palindrome” was first coined by the English playwright Ben Jonson in the 17th century, from the Greek roots palin (“again”) and dromos (“way, direction”).
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that’s spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

I’ll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.

Example:
function palindrome(str) {
  return true;
}
palindrome("Kamvalethu");

# CONCLUSION
I did it the long route when I was solving a kata but it was still correct today I want to check if the shorter way works just the same.
