# INTRODUCTION
Today we were given a project that requires us to make a grid on the web , and I will share all about that.


# BODY
A CSS Grid consists of horizontal and vertical grid tracks (rows and columns). The grid tracks define the grid items (grid cells) that are easily identifiable by the row and column they belong to. The grid container is the HTML element that contains the whole CSS Grid.

To make an element into a grid container, we need to use either the display: grid; or the display: inline-grid; property. The former results in a block-level grid, while the latter leads to an inline-level grid.


# CONCLUSION
I need to understand what is needed to create a grid first .In the CSS, we use the display: grid; property on the .container element to create a block-level CSS Grid. The grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties define the number and size of the rows and columns in the grid. That is the information i gathered.
