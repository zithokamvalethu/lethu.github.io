# INTRODUCTION
Today I was praparing for a meeting I had to hold with Tin. The meeting was about User stories. I was also busy the whole day with the RSVP App. I have made a lot of progress and I think by tomorrow I will be done with it.


# BODY
What are user stories? <br>
User stories are:<br>
Who - We define the end use of the product or the User Persona.<br>
What - We specify what the customer wants - Which is the goal of the Product. <br>
Why - We describe the benefit of the Product - That is the reason why the user needs the product's features.<br>

User stories are short statements from the users perspective.<br>

You need to Identify the user , their desire and their intetion.<br>
