# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about a method that I got introduced to today.


# BODY
The Math.floor() function <br>
-returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.<br>

This is the syntax  <br>
-Math.floor(x). Inside the parameters (x)- insert a number <br>

Return value<br>
-A number representing the largest integer less than or equal to the specified number.<br>

Math.floor() function explained in depth<br>
-Because floor() is a static method of Math, you always use it as Math. floor(), rather than as a method of a Math object you created (Math is not a constructor).<br>

Example <br>
function litres(time) {
  return Math.floor(time / 2);
}

# CONCLUSION
I learnt that this method is very useful even when working with integers.
