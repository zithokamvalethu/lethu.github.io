# Introduction
Today I am going to write about the challenges I have come across on the challelnges on Free code camp. 

# BODY
What is Data visualization with D3?
D3 stands for Data Driven Documents- it is a JavaScript library for creating a dynamic and interactive data visualization in the browser. It is made to work with web standards that are common.
It supports various input date formats.And then it uses pwerful built in methods , you can traansform the data into different charts.

 Data visualization is a graphical representation that contains the information and the data
This is where we use or take given data to plot graphs and find scales and and translate other visuals into charts. 

In these challenges I have seen that we take real life data and minimize it to transform visuals and plot charts and find scales to plot.

# Conclusion
Tomorrow I a planning to finish the challenges on D3 and go back to React since I will be getting assessed on it in the next few coming days.
