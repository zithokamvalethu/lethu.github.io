# INTRODUCTION
Today I started with this topic and managed to complete two tests on FreeCodeCamp and pass them. It is a complex topic and will require a lot of time. It is tough but pretty doable.

# BODY
What are intermediate algorithm scripting ?<br>
In my understanding, it is a mixture of OOP and basic algorithm scripting.<br> You need to remember everything you did in both these subjects.<br>
It utilises mostly higher functions in combination.<br>For instance if you come across a test which says 'Sum all numbers in a Range. The first thing you would have to do is know which method is most suitable to use and which one is not the one you should use to avoid confusion.<br> The other thing to consider is knowing how to write your code. <br>When sorting the condition differs but one main thing is that you need to return something which is in a certain order.<br> With this topic I think I will to always go back to OOP and the basic algorithm scripting to be able to understand what each test needs and how to write my answers.<br>


# CONCLUSION
I have downloaded a tutorial which I will dedicate 2 hours time to watch in order to equip myself and have fewer struggles and be able to deal also with the projects that come after while the information is still fresh.
