# INTRODUCTION
Today I was basically dealing with a lot of FreeCodeCamp just trying to do the challenges because I've been having troubles with dealing with them. I now think I am going to be better at it because I've thought myself that the most important thing is understanding. I also did Codewars, well and watched React tutorial.

How do I render components in React?
The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

A component is an independent, reusable code block which divides the UI into smaller pieces. For example, if we were building the UI of Twitter with React:

Functional Components
The first and recommended component type in React is functional components. A functional component is basically a JavaScript/ES6 function that returns a React element (JSX). 

# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I will focus on the App that I have been doing also finish up the Count down timer which I have to do using React.
