# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write about my day and the things I was doing all throughout my day.



# BODY
Today on FreeCodeCamp I learned how to pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

Also while I was doing the React project I was able to apply an Image background to my App , the styling is not the most difficult part and I can safely say I am getting a little bbit comfortable with React.


# CONCLUSION
I will finish my poroject and do the rest of the Free code camp challenges when I come back on Monday.
