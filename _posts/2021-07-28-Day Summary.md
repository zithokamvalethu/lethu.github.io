# INTRODUCTION

Today was very hectic for me I was doing a lot of work on FreeCodeCamp, Admin App and the project we were given to do at home during the holidays.
I managed tto do alot and write down some Psuedo Code which I will need for my presentation on Friday.

# BODY

What Is Psuedo Code?
It is the informal and the artificial language that helps programmers develop algorithms. <br>You have to write code but it is in a way more simplified way.<br>
I learned about validation and verification which is a matter I will also touch on when I am doing a presentation..<br>
-Verification is testing that your product meets the specifications OR requirements you have written.<br>
-Validation tests how well you addressed the business needs that caused you to write those requirements. It is also sometimes called acceptance or business testing.<br>
The challenges I was doing on FreeCodeCamp mainly touched on the benefits of using SASS. Which if I continue to name them from the list I wrote yesterday are:.<br>

It uses nested syntax:.<br>

SASS allows you to use a nested syntax, which is code contained within another piece of code that performs a wider function. In SASS, nesting allows a cleaner way of targeting elements..<br>

Benefits of nesting:

More natural syntax and easy to read in most cases.<br>
Prevents the need to rewrite selectors multiple times.<br>
Better code organization and structure thanks to its visual hierarchy, which bring us to.<br>
More maintainable code.<br>
 It uses mixins
Mixins are like functions in other programming languages. They return a value or set of values and can take parameters including default values.
for example:<br>
h1 {
  font-family: 'Ubuntu', 'Arial', 'Helvetica', sans-serif;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #004BB4;
}

# CONCLUSION

Tomorrow I will be dealing with the errors in my App and fixing them, I can safely say I am cruising smoothly at least now I can see the light. I have managed to restrict my inputs and validte some of them.
