# INTRODUCTION
Today I got here and finished the SASS challenged on FreeCodeCamp. When I was done with the challenges I went on Codewars and solved quite a few easy challenges.I also did a the last few polishing for the Presentation.

# BODY
I will mainly touch on the presentation. So I had to make a few changes on my Pseudo Code because it turned out that the one I had written was not all correct. I need to modify it so that I explain the code I had written so that should it happen that I trasnscribe my code to any language it makes sense and it is actually easy to do so. It was not an issue modifying the code into an explanation because I had to change the code looking parts into explainations or more into words.

The presentation time came and I was up first. I went in there all prepared and I presented what I had prepared. I did not get many questions which is what I prefer so that I know what to the next time and know where I went wrong. I am looking forward to the feedback and promise to take it seriously so that I do not commit the same mistakes over and over again.


# CONCLUSION

ON monday I need to begin with react so I will go home and study the past topics to reflect and see if I understood everything.
