# INTRODUCTION
We were given a task to do which is to do a Recipe box. I am going to touch on it today. How far I am with it and everything concerning it.



# BODY
It is like creating any other App but the difference is the functionality of the inputs. I had an idea already when I hadn't begun with my app and it was a good one. In the back of my mind, I thought of everything in the centre and have a nice background that fuses with the title of the App. Well, I did pull that one through with my CSS and Html skills. I knew what I wanted so it was not hard placing everything the way I wanted it. So for now I'm still searching for the easiest way I can implement my Javascript on my App. <br>
I also did the test on FreeCodeCamp and I think that they are not as hard as I thought or make them out to be they just need a pure understanding of the instructions and then apply your knowledge. I am still learning the best ways to tackle the test and not be under pressure.<br>
I could not do Codewars today because I was still stressed out by the Recipe Box App.

# CONCLUSION
My only worry is displaying and writing the correct javascript for my App to function correctly but hopefully, I will find a solution to my problem.
