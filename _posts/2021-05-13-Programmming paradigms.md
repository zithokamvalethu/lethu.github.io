# INTRODUCTION
This is an assignment about different programming paradigms and their advantages as well as their disadvantages.<br>

We have two main programming paradigms which have been further subdivided into three sub-topics each of which will be what I will mainly focus on.<br>
We have the<br> 1)Imperative programming paradigm and under it we have :<br>
a) Procedural programming paradigm<br>
b) Object-Oriented programming <br>
c)Parallel processing Approach <br>
We also have <br>2)Declerative programming paradigm:<br>
d)Logic programming paradigm<br>
e)Fuctional programming paradigm<br>
f)Database programming paradigm<br>


# BODY
 WHAT ARE PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS?
 These are different ways or techniques of writing code. <br>

 1)Imperative programming paradigm<br>
 It performs instructions step by step by changing the global state.<br>
 a) Procedural programming paradigm <br>
 It is based on structured programming and is made of procedures <br>
 It is based on the sequence of peculiar commands to work out a complication and carry a goal.  <br>
 b) Object-Oriented programming <br>
 Utilizes unrelated objects, each with an attribute and entity to come up with a solution for a problem.  <br> It is loaded with classes which makes the software structure to be easier, simple, and reusable. <br>
 c)Parallel processing Approach<br>
 We have a processor which processes instructions and then we have an output of processed data<br>

-Advantages<br>
1) It simple to implement.<br>
2) It can contain variables, loops .<br>
3) It can break problems into smaller forms<br>

-Disadvantages<br>
1) High complexity<br>
2) Less efficient<br>
3) It has no support for parallel programming<br>


 2)Declarative programming paradigm<br>
 It is short and straightforward to the point <br>
 It outlines the goal to attain with no directive to do so. <br>
 d)Logic programming paradigm
It is based on formal logic, sentences are written in a logical form in order to express some facts and rules about some problem domain <br>
The rules are not executed by the programmer but by the proof procedure <br>
 e)Functional programming paradigm
 It depends on the mathematical functions to make immutable programs. <br> This is a style of programming where the solution is simple and there are no side effects. <br>
 f)Database programming paradigm
 It is also known as 'Mathematical programming<br>
 It is the selection of the best elements from the set of alternatives<br>

 -Advantages<br>
1) The focus is more on what should be done.<br>
2) It is less verbose <br>

-Disadvantages<br>
1) There is no focus on how to do what should be done.<br>
2) The properties are described while not explaining how to compute it.<br>
 

# CONCLUSION
Programming paradigms are approaches of writing code and coming up with solutions in different programming languages.<br>
We can conclude that the Declarative programming paradigm is less verbose, simple, and straight to the point, it tells you what to do but not how to do it .<br> 
In the Imperative programming paradigm we get full information just by looking at the code we know how to achieve a goal, it more verbose and uses loops. <br>
