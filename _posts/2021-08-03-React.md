# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about React which is a topic I started on Monday.The topic is a bit hectic and and it needs a lot of understanding and it also requires patience.

# BODY
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications

Today I came across this challenge:Render HTML Elements to the DOMPassed:

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.

It was not easy finding the solution but at the end I managed to dot it.

# CONCLUSION
Luckily I have a lot going on for my App I can now calculate the salary annually and add which was a mountain to climb.
