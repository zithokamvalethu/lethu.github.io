# INTRODUCTION
Today I will write about the FreeCodeCamp challenge that is a project called Palindrome checker.


# BODY
What is a palindrome?<br>
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelt the same way both forward and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.<br>

These are the methods I used for the solution.<br>
-The toLowerCase() method to return the calling string value converted to lowercase.<br>
-The replace() method to return a new string with some or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. We will use one of the RegExp we just created earlier.<br>
-The split() method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into sub strings.<br>
-The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.<br>
-The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.<br>

# CONCLUSION
I was able to do this and move on to the next project, I think by the end of the week I'll be done with the rest of the projects. They are not so challenging hence I am confident about finishing them. The only challenge so far is with the Cipher project it is quite tough.
