# INTRODUCTION
Today was also a hectic day for me because I had to conclude my research about Pseudo Code. I have everything which I think I will need for the presentation tomorrow.


# BODY
I learned that Pseudo Code is a step-by-step written outline of your code that you can gradually transcribe into programming language.<br>

In validation we have fields which we need to check namely:<br>
1) Format check<br>
2) Range check<br>
3) Presence check<br> 
4) Type check <br>
5) Character check<br>

I think I am ready for tomorrow but one thing that I have not focused on is the Higher order functions which is the test that I am going to be writing about tomorrow but hopefully the notes I have will help me out.<br>


# CONCLUSION
Today I am going to re-write my presentation in a perfect order so that I will be able to have evrything in order when I present tomorrow and my presentation will not be hapharzard.<br>
