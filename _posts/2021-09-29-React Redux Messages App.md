# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write about the Challenge on Free code which is taking me longer than expected to complete. I am puzzled because I can't see why is it not passing. One other thing that is setting me back is that Free code camp is mulfunctioning.


# BODY
In the 'connect' component there is a term called 'Presentational' the term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux.<br>
They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive.<br> By contrast, container components are connected to Redux.<br> These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.<br>

This was the guide to the solution:<br>
Create a new component held in a constant called Container that uses connect to connect the Presentational component to Redux. Then, in the AppWrapper, render the React Redux Provider component. Pass Provider the Redux store as a prop and render Container as a child.<br>
I did all of the above but still the solution did not pass.

# CONCLUSION
I hope to finish the challenge tomorrow and perhaps ask for help since it seems tough to crack.
