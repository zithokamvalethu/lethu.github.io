# INTRODUCTION

TODAY I'LL SHARE ALL ABOUT 'FOR LOOPS'.

# BODY

Javascript loops are handy if you want to run the code over and over again, each time with a different value.
Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
for - loops through a block of code a number of times
for/in - loops through the properties of an object
for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

# CONCLUSION

Now I know that you should not use for in over an Array if the index order is important.

The index order is implementation-dependent, and array values may not be accessed in the order you expect.

It is better to use a for loop, a for of loop, or Array.forEach() when the order is important. That is it for now.
