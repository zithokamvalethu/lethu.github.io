# INTRODUCTION
Today I am just going to write regarding how my day went. Basically what I was busy doing up to now.



# BODY
The first thing I did when I got here was to add finishing touches to my Recipe App Box.<br> The closing touches I had to add were styling for my input and submit button for when I am editing on my Ingredient. <br>When I finished that I went on to FreeCodeCamp to do the past challenges I've finished and check whether did I really understand the challenge or I just went on without understanding what I was doing.<br> Particularly I went back to Functional Programming since I had the biggest challenge when It comes to it.<br> But now I can confidently say I understand it clearly.<br> I tried resolving some of the challenges which I've done already without looking at the solutions I'd jotted down for future purposes.<br> I completed a few challenges successfully and took down some important notes I'd missed which are also guidelines.<br> I managed to also solve a Codewars kata.<br> I'm taking it slowly because it is not easy solving katas, therefore I choose to take it day by day.<br> I went on to do typing so that I acquire the typing skill and improve from my current situation.<br>

# CONCLUSION
During my weekend I plan on reading my notes and looking at the solutions I've jotted down. One other thing I realized that I should start with is reading my notes so that I am always  ready for tests. Also so that I know what to do or what not to do when we're given Apps.
