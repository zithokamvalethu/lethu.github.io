# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to script about what I've learnt in Bootstrap and how am I finding it so far.

# BODY 
Bootstrap personally is not much of a problem and it is a lot simple. I have learnt to create buttons , style them, I have also learnt how to style a photo with simple styling. One thing I've come to notice is that with Bootstrap you can add more than one class to an element and the styling is done directly on your Html page to make things even simpler. The other great thing is that if you want a font for you App you can paste a link for the font instead of creating a styling element for it. In Bootstrap there are radi buttons which I do not know much about for now but soon I will learn what are they and what role do thwy perform. It is convinient also, that you can add Icons direclty to your button with Bootstrap and I am really finding there whole thing easy and super genius.

Well I will also dive right in on what I else I did... I solved katas and came across a new concept along the lines. I came across the 'ceil() function .
This function takes a number and rounds it upwards to the nearest integer and returns the result.

# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I shall spend the day fixing my Admin app and solving challenges on the FreecodeCamp
