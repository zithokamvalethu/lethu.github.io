# INTRODUCTION
Today I took some time to learn about React router dom. I was also given a small presentation by my classmate but she let out a portion of information that I was not satisfied and had to search it on my owm.

First you need to install it on your Visual studio code and then you can be able to use it and call/import it.

What is Dom react Router?<br>
React Router DOM enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. Unlike the traditional routing architecture in which the routing is handled in a configuration outside of a running app, React Router DOM facilitates component-based routing according to the needs of the app and platform.<br>
Why we use react router Dom?<br>
ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications. React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route.<br>

# CONCLUSION
I have installed the DOM react router but it fails showing on my App. I am going to learn about it and how it works.
