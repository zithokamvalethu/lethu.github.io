# Introduction
I am going to give feedback on the test that we were given today. It was a React assessment which means with had to use React to create it.


# Body
I started by creating a repo , I then went on to clone the repo and then created a react app on the cloned repo. I chose to use React classes because I have been practicing it more lately.
 We were creating an app that has an input which takes a number/integer value and also has a submit button. On submit the app needs to return the number as an asterisk. The number input takes a rating  and returns it as an asterisk that equals to the number / integer that was put on the input. I was able to have the inputs submit and return the value which was inserted. The only problem was changing the inserted value into asterisk when it's getting returned.

 # Conclusion
 Tomorrow I am going to look at the solution of the test on the internet only because today I was finishing up the free code camp challenges.
