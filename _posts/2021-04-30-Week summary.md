# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write a summaary of my week .

# BODY
So nothing is different with the stuff and work I do when I get here , I mostly start with FreeCodCamp trying to figure out a solution for the challenge on hand but FP is really giving me a tough time . Proceeding to Codewars and doing or adding changes to my websites is getting easier each day because I am getting used and familiar to the syntax and really it is less of a problem now. Well let me not forget to mention the test wwe were given which I did so bad because I could not achieve what we were mostly tested on and still a day later I am struggling with adding audio on my pictures on hover. I still want to achieve that before the end of the coming week .

Today I spent most of my time doing katas and well I can say I managed to do a lot of things and solved katas I did not think wuold be easy to solve .

# CONCLUSION
During my weekend I plan on learning about local storage , read the book about programming and finish watching tutorial videos.
