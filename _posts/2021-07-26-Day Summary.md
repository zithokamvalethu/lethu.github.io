# INTRODUCTION
 After a few weeks of being away from TCG, I am finally back. I had a lot of workloads and I just got straight to it when I came in today. Starting with FreeCodeCamp so that I can conclude with jQuery and not be left behind by other students. I have completed the jQuery challenges and I am going to write about how my day went and what I learned.

# BODY
 Today as I was busy with the challenges on FreeCodeCamp I managed to learn the concepts they use and also understand what jQuery is all about. All I have been with today much was the challenges because I had a task I had put in place for me that I am going to finish jQuery today so that I won't be left behind. I also did a few changes on my Admin App but and I came across new things which I still need to look at before I start using them and adding them to my App. I have also realized that I know what I want my App to do and know or have the clue of how to do it but the only problem is how to write the correct code because I also have the code but I need to change it and make it work correctly. I also solved katas and can say I have not forgotten about coding I can still do a lot of of the work I did before going on Lockdown Level 4.

# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I plan on focusing most of my time on the Admin App because I have been dealing with it I just have to finish it and move on to other stuff and start practicing on my own.
