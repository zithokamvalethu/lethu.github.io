# INTRODUCTION
Today I am going to write a summary for my day. I will cover eveything I spent my time on.
Well today I was not able to do much in terms of FreeCodeCamp and codewars because Moral checked his Recipe Box and gave us a presentation afterwards. The presentation took quite some time and I learnt a lot about functions and function naming.
One other thing that occupied me was the Admin App.


# BODY
On my admin app I am able to do a single thing so far which is to calculate the salary annually. I also spent time on the FreeCodeCamp challenges which I've completed by now and did a few of them and that proved that I still know how to solve the problems.
On codewars I came across a kata that had to do with Binary and because of not having enough knowledge about binary's I had to conduct a short research and teach my self a few things about binary's. After I had gathered information I went ahead and solved the kata with success.
 One other thing I learnt today is how I should create an input which add multiple strings.

 # CONCLUSION
 During my weekend I will by all means try to spend my time learning about functions.
