# INTRODUCTION 
Today I am going to draft on my week's progress.


# BODY

I got up to a lot starting from Monday because my main goal was to finish FP.<br> On Monday I did FreeCodeCamp and pushed a lot, even though I was struggling a lot but my I had the most significant takeaway from this week's tests on FreeCodeCamp.<br>  I also solved katas and I achieved that with the help of the knowledge I acquired on the FreeCodeCamp.<br>  We were also given an assignment on Tuesday which was due today end at 16:00. <br> I started working on it on Tuesday, therefore, did nothing much on that day just gave my full attention to the assignment.<br>  I manage to do half of the work and the things which were left to do were not that challenging I had to come up with my code examples, and also define the other terms I was struggling to.<br>  The assignment was based on different programming paradigms.<br>  Finding them was not a hustle but doing the code examples I can say was.<br>  I finished the assignment on Thursday and submitted it because I wanted no mistakes.<br>  Well, today I succeeded to do most of the tests that were left on FreeCodeCamp and by Monday I'll be done and move on to the next challenge.<br>  I also solved a kata and did typing as normal.<br>  Today I gained some knowledge about every and some method. <br> These methods deliver almost the same goal.<br>  Every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test and returns a boolean value true if all value meets the criteria, false if not.<br> 

# CONCLUSION
During the weekend I'll be studying about functions and try to resolve the katas I've done so far.
