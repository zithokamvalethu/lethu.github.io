# INTRODUCTION
Today since it is a Friday I will write about how my week was . Basically my low-lights and highlights, the things I was doin g, what gained and what became better .

# BODY
I have been spending time coding on FP and I am still taking it day by day , it is the most challenging yet the most simole on regarding what is expected or what the solution should come out like.The honestly not much to do or change but you only need to think critically and first of all understand what the problem is sayinh and also what is it not saying and then deal with it. I've been able to identify methods to use when approaching the problems on FreeCodeCamp which gives me hope that I will be able to finish it and move on to the next challenge holding thumbs that it does not give me the same hardship FP gave me.
With Codewars it's comming together slowly and I am making a lot of progress and one thing that I am for is that every kata that I solve gives me more knowledge and it gets better each time and it is such a satisfying feeling it gets you one step closer and you finally see the path..
Once you accomplish one thing then doing others becomes easy and you just go with the flow although days are different . Some day you good ansd feeling yourself which automatically makes you feel the thing you do and then somedays you just down and have no energy all you do i slaze and loaf around.But this week there was no day I particulaaly felt that way I was just in my good feels and most good form I did not let anything affect me because we have the power to let things affect us by letting them get to us .I did a lot of things also manage to modify the Employee tracker/progress App. A lot happened this week I must say we also had a presentation for Mr Jason so that was mostly the thing that was on my case that got me worried but I knew i'd handle everything well ..We did the presantations and besides being anxious and nervous I did well , I touched on CSS selectors , one of the Javascript methods 'document.getElementByID()' and lastly I solved a kata called Convert number to string.

# CONCLUSION
I did not have a rough week it was smooth and I enjoyed being at TCG . During the weekend i'll be watching the tutorial videos I downloaded during the week, jot down some notes and read the book I have that talks about computer programming .
