# INTRODUCTION
Today I Am going to write about creating the edit , delete and check buttons to my App.

# BODY
Since yesterday I have been implementing those three buttons on my app with small failures. I've encountering problems with my delete button , so I noticed that my function could be the faulty one.
Everytime I deleted my header on the table got deleted and that was like the biggest and most strange thing an app can do .
So I've been trying to fix that problem with no win becacuse everytime I deleted the items I want to delete did not clear from the table row .
My edit functions well as expected but the only part which I haven't done is the one which when you edit a new table appears so that you edit from it and then after editing the new update appears from the table . 
Well I have not added a checkbox and plan to get started with that right after finishing writing this blog post hoping that I will finish on time and then be able to look at my delete button and make it work .

# CONCLUSION
Making functions work and be checked as correct is pretty challenging and so is making the buttons , but the trick is not to give up. I plan on putting my every last effort on the app before I leave today .
