You are required to create your own Hello World repository not only one repository but everytime you have a project it differs according to the project you are given,and learn GitHub's Pull Request workflow.


# BODY
You need to create a Github account in order to use Github. Once your account is up and running you need to create a Repository- a repo stores everything pertinent to a specific project including files , images , spreadsheets , data sets and videos and is often sorted into files. You need to always include a README file within your repo. You the have to open a folder on the VS CODE AND CLONE repo from the GITHUB URL . After every change on your VS code you need to open your TERMINAL and :
1 Change the current working directory to your local project.
2 Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
