# INTRODUCTION

So usually on fridays I'll be writing a post about how my week went . I had a fun and productive week and I made so much progress .

# BODY

This was such a fun week for me .. I learnt about the high order function and I understood them . I know how to apply them but still need to do more because problems that will need to be solved using those methods vary.
I can use the filter method -The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
I was even able to solve a kata using the filter method and it was not that hard solving that kata because of the information that I had based on the filter method.
The other high order functions also are not hard to deal with and I think if I practice more then I'll be able to to use them on a daily basis with no struggle.
Regarding the test we had the past week on thursday I managed to put HTML page and change the structure of my website . I've put everything on the same file . Theh other thing I had a problem with was the hover part and adding audio to my images. I've manage to edit everything and now the website is alright it hovers and the audio plays and also pauses when it is supposed to . It was easy implemeting this changes this time because I had time to make mistakes and correct them because I was under no pressure , one thing that also helped is console.log that I was using to test my functions their validity.
I am slowly adapting and getting used to the work and evrything else involving coding which is my highlight . I enjoy hat I am doing a lot now .
With FreeCodeCamp there are challenges that I am able pass but still feel like I do not understand why this not that , why that not that , personally it is still hard but I am taking it day by day and giving myself enough time to learn it and understand everything

# CONCLUSION

I had a fantastic week , I learnt a lot and plan on going back to fully understand the work I've been doing this week .
