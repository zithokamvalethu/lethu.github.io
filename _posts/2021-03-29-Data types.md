# INTRODUCTION

Today i'll be sharing about Data types. There are eight which I know so far but I don't know all their purpose I only know a few for now.

-String
represents textual data. In JavaScript, strings are surrounded by quotes:
for example :'hello', "hello world!"

-Number
an integer or a floating-point number
for example :3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.

-BigInt
an integer with arbitrary precision.A BigInt number is created by appending n to the end of an integer.
for example: 900719925124740999n , 1n

- Boolean
  Any of two values: true or false
  for example: true and false

  -undefined
  a data type whose variable is not initialized
  for example let a;

null
denotes a null value
for example :let a = null;

-Symbol
data type whose instances are unique and immutable
for example: let value = Symbol('hello');

-Object
key-value pairs of collection of data
