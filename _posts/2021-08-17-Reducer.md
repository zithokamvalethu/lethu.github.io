# INTRODUCTION
I am going to write about the Reducer method.

# BODY
Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result. In other words, (state, action) => newState.

Rules of Reducers#
We said earlier that reducers must always follow some special rules:

They should only calculate the new state value based on the state and action arguments
They are not allowed to modify the existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.
They must not do any asynchronous logic or other "side effects"

A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

Logging a value to the console
Saving a file
Setting an async timer
Making an AJAX HTTP request
Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now())

# CONCLUSION
I am going to be reading more about other methods and know why the rules are important.
