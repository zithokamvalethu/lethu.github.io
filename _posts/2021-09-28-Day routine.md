# INTROSUCTION
Today I am going to write about the the things I have been doing.



# BODY
I started doing the codewars katas and I did a solution for the function which I had to shuffle name. The first name needed to move from the front to the back and vice versa.

solution:<br>
This solution particularly worked on codewars but not on my visual studio code, so I wanted to work it out and see how to make it work but have not yet done done :<br>
function nameShuffler(){<br>
    return string('').split(' ').reverse().join('')<br>

}<br>

I don't know why would it work for codewars but not in the visual studio code.<br>

I also solved a challenge in Free code camp but on the next one It became different it needed the same code not the same per se but more or less the same but a few things weere added and that's where it became a problem.
So I was still checking how to detect the problem and the Free code camp misbehaved so I couldn't finish it at all.



# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I plan on reading some handbook for Javascript functions and continue with my day-to-day work.
