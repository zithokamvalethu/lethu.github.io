# INTRODUCTION
Today we were given the first react activity. We had to do a count down timer.

# BODY
I didn't know how React works so I spent a lot of time watching tutorials and reading about react in order to start solving the activity.

After some time I started writing some code, I kept on getting errors and that de-motivated me a lot because even to begin with it was hard. So I have decided that I will not do or start with the activity as yet until I have familarised myself with how React works and the files. I need to learn the concepts and know what each file is meant for.

I also solved FreeCodeCamp challenges but it had an issue it was unresponsive so I gave it a break and that is why I couldn't do much.

# CONCLUSION
Tomorrow I will continue watching tutorials until I get how React works and start doing the activity.
