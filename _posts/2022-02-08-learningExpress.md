# INTRODUCTION

Today I did more Express as I am starting to understand it better.

# BODY

The first day of TCG we had an Alumni help session with Moral which was very fruitful and the example he did for us was very precise and clear.

What is Express.js
Express is a backend web application framework for Node.js. It may be used to develop web and mobile applications.

- What are the main features of Express js
  Allows to set up middlewares to respond to HTTP Requests.
  Defines a routing table that is used to perform different actions based on HTTP Method and URL.
  Allows to dynamically render HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
- Installing Express js globally
  Firstly, install the Express framework globally using NPM so that it can be used to create a web application using the node terminal.
  -Installing important modules along with the Express framework
  body-parser − This is a node.js middleware for handling JSON, Raw, Text, and URL encoded form data. (so far this is the only module we were taught about but the are two more that are there to also be used)
  -Request & Response
  The express application uses a callback function whose parameters are request and response objects.
  Request Object − The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
  Response Object − The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request

Basic Routing
We have seen a basic application that serves HTTP requests for the homepage. Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on)

# CONCLUSION

Learning all the basics of Express and the fundamentals has been a good start for the year personally because I had already set a goal to kick start the year by learning back end and I believe I will improve through time.
