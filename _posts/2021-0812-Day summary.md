# INTRODUCTION

Today I was doing a research about a Form using React. I gathered a lot of information and tomorrow I will start writing code for the RSVP App.


# BODY 
Adding Forms in React
You add a form with React like any other element.

Handling Forms
Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.

In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.

In React, form data is usually handled by the components.

When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.

You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute:


Conditional Rendering
If you do not want to display the h1 element until the user has done any input, you can add an if statement.

1. We create an empty variable, in this example we call it header.

2. We add an if statement to insert content to the header variable if the user has done any input.

3. We insert the header variable in the output, using curly brackets.

Submitting Forms
You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the onSubmit attribute:

# CONCLUSION

Tomorrow I am going to start with the App and do FreeCodeCamp challenges.
