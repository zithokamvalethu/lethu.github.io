# ITRODUCTION
Today I am going to write about restaring my website because the files were deleted which is what still confuses me to this point. I'll also add and talk about what I spent my day doing .

# BODY
When I got here first thing in the morning I went to update my Employee App and add the buttons and make for them to work. I managed to do that and the only thing I needed to modify is my checkbox so that it checks complete after the employee data has been submitted.
Moral checked his work and he also made the same comment which I was aware of and well I think he did a good job by giving me feedback so that i'll know where my weakness is and know how to do next time we are given a task which is similar to this one. He alsos gave us a presentation and what i've noticed about him is that his experince is profound because he does things in the most neat and straight forward way but you as a student you wouldn't know it because of course you still a student . I was able to see what better ways I could have used to make my buttons because it is what I struggled about.
Afte he checked his work I went to check my website because I remembered that I was not completely done I still had a few stuff to check and change. When I realised that I do not even have a personal website I decided to start doing it all over ... While creating my website I did not encounter problems because I now have some little experience regarding website making . I've done almost everything and the only thing left is to add styling and thats pretty muchn all left to do.
Also checked Codewars but it gave me some tough challenge which also led to me running out of time. I did some typing and I can see that I have to be really patient with myslf and rush nothing at all but keep track and never lose focus at all .
With Free Code Camp I am having a real struggle and taking it one step at a time so that everything sinks in well and is captured .

# CONCLUSION
Today I learnt how to do a website without referring from a source but managed to set it up by myself which is something i'm very ecstatic about and wish to do more of this in future. I remember when I got here and we were given this task I was totally blur and clean , knew nothing and think I was the one who struggled the most but now I see making a website as a great challenge which will grow me and better my skill.
